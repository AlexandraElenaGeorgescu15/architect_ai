## Development Workflow for Phone Swap Request Feature

Based on the provided context and requirements, the following outlines the development workflow for the Phone Swap Request feature.

**1. Planning & Design (Oct 14 - Oct 17, 2025)**

*   **Jira Ticket Creation:** The Product Manager creates a Jira ticket with the user story and acceptance criteria, referencing the meeting notes.
*   **UX Design:** The UX Team creates a wireframe of the modal and form, focusing on user-friendliness and consistency with the existing User Panel. **Due Oct 17, 2025.**
*   **Wireframe Approval:** The wireframe is reviewed and approved by the Product Manager, Engineering Lead, and relevant stakeholders.

**2. Backend Development (Oct 17 - Oct 21, 2025)**

*   **API Endpoint Development:** The Backend Team develops the `POST /api/phone-swaps` API endpoint to handle form submissions. **Target Completion Oct 21, 2025.**
*   **Database Schema Definition:** The Backend Team defines the schema for the "Phone Swap Request" table in the relational database, including `requester's ID`, `requested phone ID`, `offered phone ID`, `status (default 'Pending')`, and `comment (optional)`.
*   **Validation Implementation:** Implement backend validation to ensure the user owns the offered phone and to handle other data integrity checks.

**3. Frontend Development (Oct 17 - Oct 24, 2025 - Timeline is dependent on UX and Backend.)**

*   **Component Creation:**  The Frontend Team builds the "Request Phone Swap" button and the basic modal structure.
*   **Form Implementation:** Implement the form within the modal, including the "Phone to Request," "Phone to Exchange," and "Reason for Request" fields.
*   **Data Population:** Populate the "Phone to Request" dropdown with available phones and the "Phone to Exchange" dropdown with phones owned by the logged-in user.
*   **Submission Handling:** Implement the "Submit Request" and "Cancel" buttons and the confirmation message upon successful submission.
*   **Styling:** Ensure consistent visual language with the existing User Panel using Angular Material, responsive design, and accessibility features.

**4. Integration & Testing**

*   **API Integration:**  Integrate the frontend with the newly developed backend API endpoint.
*   **End-to-End Testing:** Verify the entire swap request workflow from button click to database storage (see Testing Workflow below).

## Testing Workflow for Phone Swap Request Feature

This workflow outlines the testing activities required to ensure the quality and functionality of the Phone Swap Request feature.

**1. Unit Testing**

*   **Frontend:**
    *   Unit tests for individual Angular components, directives, and services.
    *   Test form validation logic.
    *   Verify the correct behavior of the modal and its components.
*   **Backend:**
    *   Unit tests for API endpoint logic.
    *   Test database interaction and data validation.
    *   Verify authentication and authorization logic.

**2. Integration Testing**

*   Test the interaction between the frontend and backend components.
*   Verify that the API endpoint correctly handles form submissions.
*   Test the database storage and retrieval of swap requests.

**3. End-to-End (E2E) Testing**

*   Use automated E2E tests (e.g., Cypress, Protractor) to simulate user interactions and verify the entire swap request workflow.
*   Test the workflow from clicking the "Request Phone Swap" button to receiving a confirmation message.
*   Verify that the data is correctly stored in the database.

**4. Manual Testing**

*   **Functional Testing:** Manually test all form fields, button actions, and workflow scenarios.
*   **UI/UX Testing:** Verify the visual appearance and user experience of the modal and form.
*   **Accessibility Testing:** Ensure the feature is accessible to users with disabilities (keyboard navigation, screen reader compatibility).  WCAG AA compliance verification.
*   **Responsive Testing:** Test the feature on different screen sizes and devices.
*   **Acceptance Criteria Verification:** Verify that all acceptance criteria from the user story are met.

**5. Performance Testing**

*   Load testing of the API endpoint to ensure it can handle a realistic number of requests.
*   Verify the performance of data filtering and retrieval, especially for the "Phone to Request" and "Phone to Exchange" dropdowns (Debouncing needs to be verified).

**6. Security Testing**

*   Verify that the API endpoint is protected against common security vulnerabilities.
*   Ensure that user data is properly secured.

**7. Test Data Management**

*   Create and maintain test data for different scenarios.
*   Ensure that test data is realistic and covers all possible edge cases.

## Deployment Workflow for Phone Swap Request Feature

This workflow describes the steps involved in deploying the Phone Swap Request feature to a production environment.

**1. Code Review**

*   All code changes must be reviewed by at least two developers (see Code Review Process below).

**2. Build & Packaging**

*   **Frontend:** Create an optimized production build of the Angular application using Angular CLI (`ng build --prod`).
*   **Backend:** Package the API endpoint and database schema changes for deployment.

**3. Staging Deployment**

*   Deploy the frontend and backend changes to a staging environment.
*   Run integration and E2E tests in the staging environment to verify the deployment.

**4. User Acceptance Testing (UAT)**

*   Allow selected users to test the feature in the staging environment.
*   Collect feedback and address any issues before proceeding to production.

**5. Production Deployment**

*   Deploy the frontend and backend changes to the production environment.

**6. Monitoring & Validation**

*   Monitor the performance and stability of the feature in production.
*   Verify that the feature is working as expected and that no errors are occurring.

**7. Post-Deployment Review**

*   Conduct a post-deployment review to identify any lessons learned and areas for improvement.

## Code Review Process

This process outlines the steps for code review to ensure code quality, maintainability, and adherence to team standards.

**1. Code Submission**

*   The developer creates a pull request (PR) to merge their changes into the main branch.

**2. Review Assignment**

*   The PR is assigned to at least two reviewers (Bogdan (Eng Lead), Radu (Frontend), other team members with relevant expertise).

**3. Code Inspection**

*   Reviewers thoroughly inspect the code for:
    *   Code quality (readability, maintainability)
    *   Correctness (logic, functionality)
    *   Security vulnerabilities
    *   Adherence to team coding standards (including testing standards)
    *   Performance considerations
    *   Accessibility (keyboard navigation, screen reader)

**4. Feedback & Iteration**

*   Reviewers provide feedback on the PR.
*   The developer addresses the feedback and updates the PR.
*   This process repeats until the reviewers are satisfied with the changes.

**5. Approval & Merge**

*   Once the reviewers approve the PR, it can be merged into the main branch.

**6. Automated Checks**

*   Automated checks (e.g., linters, unit tests, static analysis) should be integrated into the PR process to catch common errors early.  These must pass before the PR can be merged.
