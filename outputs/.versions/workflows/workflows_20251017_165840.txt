## Phone Swap Request Feature: Development, Testing, and Deployment Workflows

Based on the provided context, the following workflows are proposed for the "Phone Swap Request" feature.

### 1. Development Workflow

**Objective:** To develop the "Phone Swap Request" feature, ensuring adherence to requirements and team standards.

**Steps:**

1.  **Jira Ticket Creation:** The Product Manager creates a formal Jira ticket with the defined user story and acceptance criteria.
2.  **UI Wireframe Design:** The UX Team creates the wireframe of the modal and form by the end of day, October 17.
3.  **Wireframe Approval:** The Frontend Team begins implementation once the wireframes are approved.
4.  **Frontend Development:**
    *   Build the "Request Phone Swap" button and the basic modal structure using Angular and Angular Material.
    *   Implement the form with dropdowns for "Phone to Request" and "Phone to Exchange," and a text area for "Reason for Request."
    *   Add "Submit Request" and "Cancel" buttons.
    *   Display a confirmation message upon successful submission.
5.  **Backend Development:**
    *   The Backend Team develops the new API endpoint (`POST /api/phone-swaps`) and database schema (likely .NET and MongoDB). Target completion: October 21.
    *   Implement validation to ensure the requester owns the offered phone and the status is set to "Pending" by default.
6.  **Code Review:** (See Code Review Process below)
7.  **Integration:**  Frontend and Backend teams integrate their components.
8.  **Development Environment Setup:**
    *   Angular CLI (latest stable version)
    *   Node.js 18+ LTS
    *   Target Browsers: Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge

### 2. Testing Workflow

**Objective:** To ensure the quality and functionality of the "Phone Swap Request" feature through rigorous testing.

**Testing Strategy Elements (Based on agent code context):**

1.  **Unit Testing:**
    *   Frontend: Test individual components of the modal and form (e.g., button click handlers, form validation).
    *   Backend: Test API endpoint logic, database interactions, and validation rules.
2.  **Integration Testing:**
    *   Verify communication between frontend and backend components.
    *   Test data flow from the UI to the API and database.
3.  **End-to-End Testing:**
    *   Test the entire workflow, from clicking the "Request Phone Swap" button to receiving confirmation.  Simulate a user completing the entire process.
4.  **Performance Testing:**
    *   Measure API response time and dropdown loading efficiency.
    *   Address performance bottlenecks (e.g., implement debouncing or throttling if needed, as suggested in the design document).
5.  **Security Testing:**
    *   Validate input data to prevent security vulnerabilities.
    *   Implement proper authentication and authorization for the API endpoint.
6.  **User Acceptance Testing (UAT):**
    *   Verify that the feature meets the acceptance criteria defined in the Jira ticket.
    *   Manual testing: all "Given/When/Then" scenarios, accessibility (keyboard navigation, screen reader), responsive grid/list modes, mobile layout
7.  **Test Data Management:**
    *   Use mock data during development and testing phases, ensuring it mirrors the real API contract.
8.  **CI/CD Integration:**
    *   Automate testing as part of the CI/CD pipeline.

**Specific Testing Requirements (From extracted requirements):**

*   Frontend: Verify the modal opens correctly, and the form fields are displayed as expected.
*   Frontend: Test the "Submit Request" and "Cancel" buttons.
*   Frontend: Check for proper display of the confirmation message upon submission.
*   Backend: Ensure the API endpoint correctly handles form submissions.
*   Backend: Validate data storage in the database.
*   Backend: Verify phone ownership validation logic.

**Manual Testing (outputs/design.md context):**

*   Acceptance Criteria: All Given/When/Then scenarios.
*   Accessibility: Keyboard navigation, screen reader compatibility.
*   Responsive Design: Grid/list modes, mobile layout.

### 3. Deployment Workflow

**Objective:**  To deploy the "Phone Swap Request" feature to the production environment in a safe and reliable manner.

**Steps:**

1.  **Build Configuration:** Ensure both Production and Development builds are configured appropriately, production build with optimized bundles, development build with source maps and hot reload.
2.  **Code Freeze:**  A code freeze is implemented prior to deployment.
3.  **Environment Configuration:** Configure the target environment (e.g., Azure, AWS, GCP) with necessary dependencies and settings.
4.  **Deployment:** Deploy the frontend and backend components to the staging environment.
5.  **Staging Testing:** Perform comprehensive testing in the staging environment to ensure stability and functionality.
6.  **Production Deployment:** Deploy the frontend and backend components to the production environment.
7.  **Monitoring:** Monitor the deployed feature for performance and errors using telemetry and logging.
8.  **Rollback Plan:** Have a rollback plan in place in case of issues.

### 4. Code Review Process

**Objective:** To maintain code quality and consistency through peer review.

**Steps:**

1.  **Developer Completes Task:** A developer completes their assigned task (frontend or backend).
2.  **Code Submission:** The developer submits their code for review (e.g., via a pull request in Git).
3.  **Reviewer Assignment:** A designated reviewer (or reviewers) is assigned to review the code.
4.  **Code Review:** The reviewer examines the code for:
    *   Adherence to coding standards and best practices.
    *   Correctness and functionality.
    *   Security vulnerabilities.
    *   Code clarity and maintainability.
    *   Test coverage.
5.  **Feedback and Revision:** The reviewer provides feedback to the developer.  The developer revises the code based on the feedback.
6.  **Re-review (If Necessary):** If significant changes were made, the reviewer re-reviews the code.
7.  **Approval:** Once the reviewer is satisfied, they approve the code.
8.  **Merge:** The approved code is merged into the main branch.
