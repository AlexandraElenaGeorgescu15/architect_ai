The Frontend component includes a Modal Pop-up that contains a Form with several entities: Phone to Request, Phone to Exchange, Reason for Request (Optional), and Actions. The Backend component includes an API Endpoint and a Database Schema, which stores Swap Requests in a table with columns for the requester's ID, requested phone, offered phone, status, and comment.\n\nNote that this diagram is specific to the provided context and references entities, features, and requirements from the meeting notes and project documentation.",
