The relationships between these entities are as follows:\n\n* A `User` can own multiple `Phone`s (one-to-many).\n* A `Phone-Swap` is requested by a `User` who owns one or more `Phone`s. This relationship is represented by the `owns` association.\n* A `Phone-Swap` involves two `Phone`s: the one being requested and the one being offered in exchange. This relationship is represented by the `requested-for` and `offered-in-exchange` associations.\n* The status of a `Phone-Swap` is represented by the `Status` entity, which has a many-to-one relationship with `Phone-Swap`.\n\nThe ERD also includes the necessary attributes for each entity: `id`, `name`, `model`, `condition`, and `comment`.",
