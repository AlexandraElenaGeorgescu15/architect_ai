          "content": "Based on your requirements, here's a high-level overview of how you might structure this feature in Python for the backend (Django Rest Framework), TypeScript/JavaScript for the frontend. \n\nFrontend implementation:\n```typescript\nimport { Component } from '@angular/core';\nimport { NzModalService } from 'ng-zorro-antd/modal';\nimport { PhoneService } from 'src/app/services/phone.service';\n\n@Component({\n  selector: 'app-table-page',\n  templateUrl: './table-page.component.html',\n  styleUrls: ['./table-page.component.scss']\n})\nexport class TablePageComponent {\n  constructor(private phoneService: PhoneService, private modal: NzModalService) {}\n\n  openPhoneSwapRequestModal(): void {\n    this.modal.create({\n      nzTitle: 'Phone Swap Request',\n      nzContent: PhoneSwapRequestComponent, // This component will contain your form and logic for submitting the request\n    });\n  }\n}\n```\nFor the `PhoneSwapRequestComponent`, you would need to create a reactive form in Angular with validators for each field. You can populate the dropdowns (Phone to Request & Phone to Exchange) by calling your phone service's `getPhones()` method. Upon successful submission, make an HTTP POST request to your new API endpoint (`/api/phone-swaps`).\n\nBackend implementation:\n```python\nfrom django.urls import path\nfrom .views import PhoneSwapRequestView\n\nurlpatterns = [\n    path('api/phone-swaps', PhoneSwapRequestView.as_view()),\n]\n```\nIn your `PhoneSwapRequestView`, you would handle the POST request and validate the data before saving it to your database:\n```python\nfrom rest_framework import views, status\nfrom .models import SwapRequest\n# Assuming SwapRequest has fields for requester's ID, requested phone, offered phone, status (defaulting to 'Pending'), and comment.\n\nclass PhoneSwapRequestView(views.APIView):\n    def post(self, request):\n        # Validate the data here\n        # If valid, create a new SwapRequest instance with the data and save it to the database\n        return Response({\"message\": \"Success\"}, status=status.HTTP_201_CREATED)\n```\nFor the backend validation part, you can use Django's built-in form validation or use a library like Django Rest Framework's serializers for more complex validations. \n\nPlease note that this is just a high-level overview and actual implementation might need adjustments based on your existing codebase, project conventions and specific requirements. For instance, error handling and response status codes should be added according to your application needs. Also, the frontend part has not been included as it's quite lengthy and would depend heavily on how exactly you want to design the form and modal.\n",
