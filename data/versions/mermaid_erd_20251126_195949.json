The main entities are:\n\n* `CUSTOMER`: represents a user who can request a phone swap.\n* `PHONE_SWAP_REQUEST`: represents a request to exchange one phone for another.\n* `PHONE`: represents a phone that can be requested or offered as part of a swap.\n\nThe relationships between these entities are:\n\n* A customer (`CUSTOMER`) has many phone swap requests (`PHONE_SWAP_REQUEST`).\n* A phone swap request (`PHONE_SWAP_REQUEST`) is related to two phones: the one being requested (`requested_phone`) and the one being offered in exchange (`offered_phone`).\n* A customer (`CUSTOMER`) owns many phones (`PHONE`).\n\nThe `PHONE_SWAP_REQUEST` table has the following columns:\n\n* `id`: a unique identifier for each request.\n* `requester_id`: the ID of the customer making the request, referencing the `CUSTOMER` table.\n* `requested_phone_id`: the ID of the phone being requested, referencing the `PHONE` table.\n* `offered_phone_id`: the ID of the phone being offered in exchange, referencing the `PHONE` table.\n* `status`: the status of the request (defaulting to 'Pending').\n* `comment`: any additional comments provided by the customer.\n\nThe `PHONE` table has the following columns:\n\n* `id`: a unique identifier for each phone.\n* `customer_id`: the ID of the customer who owns the phone, referencing the `CUSTOMER` table.\n\nThis ERD diagram captures the key entities and relationships involved in the Phone Swap Request feature, ensuring that the data is properly structured to support the required functionality.",
