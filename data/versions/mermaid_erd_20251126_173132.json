A user owns one or more phones.\n2. Each phone has a unique ID and is offered in exchange for another phone through a swap request.\n3. The requested phone and the offered phone are both instances of the PHONE entity.\n4. A swap request belongs to a specific user and includes information about the requested phone, the offered phone, and any additional comments.\n5. Comments are associated with each swap request.\n\nThis ERD should provide a solid foundation for designing the database schema and implementing the Phone Swap Request feature.",
