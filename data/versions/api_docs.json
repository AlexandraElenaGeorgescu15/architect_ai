This new feature aims to create a streamlined, in-app workflow to manage these requests efficiently.\n\n### Feature Overview\nThe team agreed on the following user story: \"As a user, I want to request a phone from the available list and offer one of my current phones in exchange, so I can easily manage my device swaps.\" The feature will be implemented as a modal pop-up on the main phone list page.\n\n## Implementation Details\n### Frontend  (UI/UX)\nA new button, labeled \"Request Phone Swap\", will be added to the main phone page. Clicking this button will trigger a modal (pop-up) that overlays the current view. The modal will contain a form with the following fields:\n   - Phone to Request: A dropdown list populated with all available phones from the main list.\n   - Phone to Exchange: A dropdown list showing only the phones currently owned by the logged-in user.\n   - Reason for Request (Optional): A text area for any additional comments.\nActions: \"Submit Request\" and \"Cancel\" buttons. Upon successful submission, the modal will close, and a confirmation message will be displayed.\n\n### Backend  (Logic)\nA new API endpoint (POST /api/phone-swaps) will be created to handle form submissions. A new table will be created in the database to store swap requests. It will include columns for the requester's ID, the requested phone, the offered phone, a status (defaulting to 'Pending'), and the comment. Backend validation will ensure that the user making the request is the actual owner of the phone being offered in exchange.\n\n## Action Items\n- UX Team: Create a wireframe of the modal and form by EOD, October 17.\n- Backend Team: Develop the new API endpoint and database schema. Target completion: October 21.\n- Frontend Team: Build the \"Request Phone Swap\" button and the basic modal structure. Begin implementation once wireframes are approved.\n- Product Manager: Create the formal Jira ticket with the defined user story and acceptance criteria.\n\n## Project Context (from codebase)\n### Key Project Entities (Most Important) \n   - UserDto  (class)\n   - WeatherForecast  (class)\n   - UsersController  (class)\n   - WeatherForecastController  (class)\n   - IUserService  (class)\n   - UserService  (class)\n   - IMongoDBSettings  (class)\n   - MongoDBSettings  (class)\n   - AppRoutingModule  (class)\n   - AppComponent  (class)\n   - AppModule  (class)\n   - AuthenticationModule  (class)\n   - LoginComponent  (class)\n   - RegisterComponent  (class)\n   - NameUppercasePipe  (class)\n\n### Codebase Context (High Relevance)\nSnippet 1-3: Handles user authentication and registration.
