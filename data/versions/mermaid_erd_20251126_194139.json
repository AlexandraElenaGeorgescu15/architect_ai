The user clicks the \"Request Phone Swap\" button, triggering a modal popup to appear.\n2. The modal contains a form with three fields: Phone to Request (dropdown list of available phones), Phone to Exchange (dropdown list of phones owned by the logged-in user), and Reason for Request (optional text area).\n3. When the user submits the form, the backend validation checks if the user is the actual owner of the phone being offered in exchange.\n4. If the submission is successful, a confirmation message is displayed, and the modal closes.\n5. If the submission is invalid (e.g., the user is not the owner of the offered phone), an error message is displayed, and the modal stays open until the issue is corrected.\n\n**Notes**\n\n* The wireframe for the modal and form should be created by EOD October 17 as per the action item.\n* The new API endpoint (POST /api/phone-swaps) will handle form submissions.\n* A new table will be created in the database to store swap requests, including columns for the requester's ID, requested phone, offered phone, status, and comment.\n\n**Validation**\n\nThe Mermaid flowchart ensures that all possible paths are accounted for, from the user clicking the \"Request Phone Swap\" button to the successful or unsuccessful submission of the form. The validation process checks if the user is the actual owner of the phone being offered in exchange, preventing potential issues with swap requests.",
