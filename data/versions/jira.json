The \"Request Phone Swap\" button is added to the main phone page.\n2. Clicking the button triggers a modal pop-up that overlays the current view.\n3. The modal contains a form with the following fields:\n\t* Phone to Request: A dropdown list populated with all available phones from the main list.\n\t* Phone to Exchange: A dropdown list showing only the phones currently owned by the logged-in user.\n\t* Reason for Request (Optional): A text area for any additional comments.\n\t* Actions: \"Submit Request\" and \"Cancel\" buttons.\n4. Upon successful submission, the modal closes, and a confirmation message is displayed.\n5. The new API endpoint (POST /api/phone-swaps) handles form submissions.\n6. The database schema includes columns for the requester's ID, the requested phone, the offered phone, status (defaulting to 'Pending'), and comment.\n\n**Estimated Effort:** 3 days\n**Labels:**\n- Phone Swap Request Feature\n- In-app Workflow\n- User Story\n\n**Task Assignments:**\n\n* UX Team: Create a wireframe of the modal and form by EOD, October 17.\n* Backend Team: Develop the new API endpoint and database schema. Target completion: October 21.\n* Frontend Team: Build the \"Request Phone Swap\" button and the basic modal structure. Begin implementation once wireframes are approved.\n\n**Product Manager:** Create this formal Jira ticket with defined user story and acceptance criteria.",
