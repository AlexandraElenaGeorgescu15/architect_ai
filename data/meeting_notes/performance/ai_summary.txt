 As a construction project analyst, I am pleased to present the BOM optimization KPIs for your project. The data shows a significant improvement in cost savings and supply chain risk reduction. The baseline cost of the project was $68,425, which has been optimized to $21,620, resulting in an estimated savings of $46,805. This reduction in cost is a direct result of the optimization efforts and will have a positive impact on the project's overall financial performance.

Furthermore, the BOM optimization has also addressed potential supply chain risks. The number of out-of-stock items has been reduced from an unspecified quantity to just 4, which will help minimize project delays. Additionally, the project delay risk days have been reduced by 56 days, further mitigating potential disruptions to the project timeline. These improvements in supply chain management will contribute to a smoother and more efficient project execution, ultimately leading to higher customer satisfaction and a stronger market reputation.
